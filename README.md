# Hey there, I'm Aviv.

#### Full stack engineer in the Ruby / Ruby on Rails ecosystem of close to a decade. A hobbyist of finance and accounting. Academically a statistics/math student. Some of the fun stuff I've made:
- [Turbulence regime switch](https://github.com/pugsiman/turbulence-regime-switch) is a nifty signal based on the measure Mahalanobis distance to detect anomalous markets!
- [Market beta supply](https://github.com/pugsiman/market-beta-supply) is my model for tracking changes in the availability of high beta stocks. It has interesting benefits for hedging and speculation
- [Reading group manager for discord](https://github.com/pugsiman/reading-group-manager) Is a node.js discord bot I've made to enable an academic reading group that once supported hundreds of readers and some special utilities

I'm always happy to discuss philosophy, system sciences, and markets!
