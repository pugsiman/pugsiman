# Hey, I'm Aviv.
#### Full stack engineer in the Ruby / Ruby on Rails ecosystem of close to a decade. Hobbyist of finance and accounting. Statistics/math student.

My hobbies include:
- Hiking & backpacking
- Reading & studying
- Biking

Some of the fun stuff I've made:
- [Turbulence regime switch](https://github.com/pugsiman/turbulence-regime-switch) is a nifty signal based on the measure Mahalanobis distance used to detect anomalous markets!
- [Market beta supply](https://github.com/pugsiman/market-beta-supply) is my model for tracking changes in the supply of high beta stocks. It has interesting benefits for hedging and speculation
- [Reading group manager for discord](https://github.com/pugsiman/reading-group-manager) Is a node.js discord bot I've made to enable an academic reading group that once supported hundreds of readers and some special utilities

I'm always happy to discuss philosophy, system sciences, or markets :)
